# Discord Personal Assistant

This is my first go at a Discord Bot. I am in multiple servers that usually use bots for metagame interactions, but this is a personal assistant style bot for my own personal server.

    [ ] Includes weather at morning, noon and night, and allergen updates in an Embed
* Stock Updates
    [ ] List of stocks that are being followed
    [ ] Add to and remove from list
* Good morning and good night messages, sort of like a turndown service and wake up call
    [ ] This will include the aforementioned updates
    [ ] The end of the day will include stats for the below habit tracking/task tracking
* Habit tracking/task tracking
